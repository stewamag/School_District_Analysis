# School_District_Analysis
Analyzing standardized test data from a city school district. Aggregating data to find trends and patterns in school performance in order to inform funding decisions. Analysis was done using Python 3.7.13 and Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8.

## Overview of the school district analysis:

The purpose of the project was to analyze school funding and standardized test scores. The analysis will allow schools and districts to be able to make decisions for the future.

The results of the analysis contain:
	- The school district's performance as a whole
	- Each individual school's performance
	- Data frames containing information on:
		* Top and bottom 5 schools based on percentage of students passing
		* A breakdown of average math and reading scores by grade level by school
		* School budgets per student and how the school performed
		* School size and how the school performed
		* School type and how it performed

## Results:

### The school district's performance as a whole:

With all 15 schools together, 64.9% of the students passed both reading and math.

### Each individual school's performance:

The results were pretty varied across the schools. In general, there's wasn't much middle ground when it came to achievement. Either the schools performed very well or they performed poorly.

### Top 5 Schools: 

The top 5 schools all had 90% or more students passing both reading and math. All of these schools were charter schools.

### Bottom 5 Schools:

The bottom 5 schools had barely more than half of the students passing both reading and math. All of these schools were public schools.

### Math Scores by Grade Level:

### Reading Scores by Grade Level:

### Scores by School Spending:

The less money spent per student, the higher the educational achievement.

### Scores by School Size: 

Small and medium sized schools achieved similar scores. Large schools achieved the lowest scores.

### Score by School Type

Charter schools performed exponentially better than that of their public school counterparts.

## Summary:

The results show that the type of school is what primarily dictates scores. Charter schools perform better than public schools.
	- Public schools receive more funding than charter, but the scores are much lower
		* This is most likely due to the demographic of students enrolled in each school
			- Charter school students are hand selected from applicants, where public school students must attend whatever school is within their school zone.
			- Students attending charter school are generally more affluent than their counterparts in public school, meaning they have more financial support in the home and most likely more emotional and education support as well.
			- Throwing more money at these schools is not solving the problem. It is a systemic economic, political, and societal issue that needs to be addressed before any improvement can be seen in something like test scores.
